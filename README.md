Course Project

(find all project-related materials in the https://github.com/adrianovalexey/Geeting-and-Cleaning-data/tree/master/week3/project/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset directory, however, copies of the important files have been put into this main directory to fulfill the submission requirement)

Change working directory to your filesystev (line 5 and 22)
All data would be unzipped.
And run file in your R Studio or R console from working directory (line 5)

Use data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_averages.txt") to read the data. It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30 * 6 = 180 rows. Note that the provided R script has no assumptions on numbers of records, only on locations of files.
